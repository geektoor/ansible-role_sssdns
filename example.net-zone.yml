# This is an example DNS zone. Save it just as the name of the domain, like
# example.net and put it into sssdns_dns_zones directory.
#
# Note: A zone is perfectly fine without any records, so you can simply
# add a domain to your servers by creating an empty file and add records
# later.

# Optional: the E-Mail address of the person responsible for the zone.
# The @ must be replaced by a dot. If there is a dot prior the @-sign, you
# need to quote it with a backslash, like mr\.admin.example.com.
# And don't forget to add the dot at the end.
#zoneadmin: dnsdepartment.example.org.

# Optional: the default TimeToLife for the whole zone.
# Default: 3600 seconds (one hour)
#ttl: 600

# Optional: the refresh time for the secondaries
# Default: 10800 seconds (3 hours)
#refresh: 10800

# Optional: the retry time for the secondaries
# Default: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
#retry: 3600

# Optional: how long will the secondaries keep the domain alive if your
# hidden primary is not reached.
# Default: 604800 seconds (two weeks)
#expire: 604800

# Optional: how long is a "negative" answer allowed to be cached
# Default: 900 seconds (15 mins)
#min_ttl: 900

# Optional: instead of the default dnszone.j2 template, you can specify your
# own template here. Just place it as sssdns_dnszone_TEMPLATE.j2 in your
# plays 'templates' directory. Replace TEMPLATE in the filename by the name
# you set as template here. If the template is missing, we'll fall back to
# the build in template. Additionally you can place a file named
# sssdns_dnszone_default.j2 in your 'templates' folder to override the built
# in zone. Keep in mind that this may break things, so do it at your own
# risk.
#template: parkeddomain

# The DNS records, one per row, no real input validation, but the role
# will not load a broken zone as its validated on the DNS server.
#records:
## This will create an MX record at domain level (@ is replaced by the zone)
## pointing to the host mail(.exampl.net.) with a priority of 10.
## Don't forget to add the mail record later as well.
#  - host: '@'
#    type: MX
#    data: 10 mail
## This creates an spf record for your domain as well.
#  - host: '@'
#    type: TXT
#    data: "v=spf1 mx ~all"
## This will create an IPv4 record for host www(.example.net.) pointing to
## IP 203.0.113.80
#  - host: www
#    type: A
#    data: 203.0.113.80
## This will create an IPv6 record for host www(.example.net.) pointing to
## IP 2001:db8:80::80
#  - host: www
#    type: AAAA
#    data: 2001:db8:80::80
## This creates an alias (CNAME) for project(.example.net.) pointing to www
#  - host: project
#    type: CNAME
#    data: www
