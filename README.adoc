SSSDNS
======

A role to manage knot dns (containerized) as a (public) dns server setup for your domains.


Requirements
------------

You need to have at least 3 hosts available, CentOS8/RHEL8 based, from which two will be exposed as DNS servers and the 3rd one will act as a hidden primary to publish data to your DNS servers. Its also recommended to use two public domains from different toplevel domains your DNS servers will be hosted in.

An example configuration would be: +
Domains: example.com, example.org +
Hosts: servera.example.com, serverb.example.org, serverx.somewhere.tld

Best case, the domains are registered with glue records, so the nameservers of those domains are within the domain itself: ns1.example.com and ns2.example.com for example.com and ns1.example.org and ns2.example.org for example.org. This is to avoid "cross references" which can cause trouble if something fails in the chain of references. The current template will also add the needed records to those domains, so you can use this fully self hosting.

Role Variables
--------------

There are only a very few variables that you need to set, all the rest will be generated for you based on your inventory/variables.
