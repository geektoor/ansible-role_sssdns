# This can be useful if you want to have certain hosts defined to a subset
# of domains. So in each of those zones, simply set the template variable
# and ensure the template exists in a templates directory. If the template
# is missing, we'll default fall back to the shipped template. And if you
# don't like the shipped dnszone file, you can place a modified version in
# your templates directory and name it "sssdns_dnszone_default.j2" to override
# the default template in your deployment.
