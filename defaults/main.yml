# You can specify the hostname prefix for your main dns servers. Their name
# is build like so: {{nameserverprefix}}{{dnsid}}.{{dnsserverdomains}}
# So for example if you set the following variables:
# sssdns_nameserverprefix: dns
# sssdns_dnsserverdomains: example.com
#
# Your DNS servers will be named:
# - dns1.example.com
# - dns2.example.com
sssdns_nameserverprefix: ns

# In every DNS zone, the SOA (Start of Authority) contains an E-Mail address
# of the person responsible for the zone. Since '@' is not possible, you have
# to replace the @-sign with a dot (.). So zoneadmin@example.com becomes
# zoneadmin.example.com. And as DNS automatically appends the zone name if
# there is no dot at the end, you have to add that dot in the end as well.
# If your zone name is the same as the E-Mail address domain, you just can
# write "zoneadmin" here. If your E-Mail address contains a dot prior the
# @-sign, please quote it with a backslash (\).
#
# By default its set to your first listed DNS Servers Domain, but you can
# also override it within each zone using the zoneadmin parameter. So in
# this example it becomes: zoneadmin@example.com.
sssdns_zoneadmin: "zoneadmin.{{ sssdns_dnsserverdomains[0] }}."

# With this variable, the directory is set to the directory containing all
# your DNS zone files (the yml ones).

# On some systems, systemd-resolved is active, preventing a DNS server from
# listening to "any@53". So by default we will disable systemd-resolved.
